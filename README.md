# Initial User Research

To better understand our users' needs, we conducted a survey with carefully crafted questions. This valuable data influenced our design choices for FoodTracker, ensuring it meets user preferences. Our user-centric approach guarantees a seamless and tailored experience to tackle food waste effectively.

1. How much food is wasted annually by an average American household? Would you care to take a guess?
   - Do you think you are above or below average?
2. What do you think is the biggest contributor to food waste in your home?
   - Are there particular items you seem to throw away the most?
3. Have you tried any approach in reducing your food waste at home?
4. Do you have a way of keeping track of food waste/grocery expiration dates currently?
5. Would you like to be reminded of when things in their refrigerator will expire?
   - How would you like to be notified?
   - How often would you like to be reminded?
6. Are there any other questions you wish I would have asked?
