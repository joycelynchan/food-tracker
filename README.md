# HCI Final Project

Did you know that millions of tons of food go to waste each year, resulting in significant economic losses? According to recent studies, the average American household wastes approximately 200 pounds of food annually, amounting to a staggering $1,500 worth of edible items thrown away. This alarming trend not only impacts our wallets but also places an immense strain on the environment and resources used in food production. With FoodTracker, we aim to tackle this issue head-on by empowering individuals to make more informed choices about their food consumption, reducing waste, and saving money in the process. By harnessing the power of technology, FoodTracker is revolutionizing the way we manage our food, making a positive impact on both our wallets and the planet. Together, let's take a stand against food waste and embrace a more sustainable future with FoodTracker.

# Findings:

People interviewed were not able to accurately gauge how much food they wasted, or how much food is wasted on average.
The best they could do was consider a particular kind of food like cilentro or produce and guess if that food was wasted more often than necessary. It was also commented that notifications would be preferred to be kept to a minimum. Such as only notifying the user if items are likely to expire within two days, and summarising that list once a day.  When asked why food went to waste the most common answers given was inability to accurately gauge how much several people would eat, or willingness to cook after coming home.

# Prototype Iterations

Initial prototype: To simplify the prototyping process, we opted to utilize Figma, a widely-used tool. We put in ideas how we thought the app might work:

# Heuristic evaluation:

Through a rigorous process of heuristic evaluation, we meticulously analyzed our prototype to identify areas for improvement. Taking the feedback into account, we iterated on the design, addressing usability issues and enhancing user experience. By incorporating the insights gained from the evaluation, we refined the prototype, resulting in a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, edited text size and color to make it easier to view, removed one of the add buttons to make moving through the app easier to understand, and added a continue as guest button instead of requiring users to create an account.

# Usability study:

To test the usability of our prototype, we asked some family members to complete the tasks below:

## Task 1: Add an item to the List
- Open the app and navigate to the List page
- Add a new item to the list, with a name and date of purchase
- Save the item and confirm that it has been added to the list

## Task 2: Set a reminder for an expiring item
- Navigate to the List page and find an item that will expire soon
- Set a reminder for the item to be notified when it's about to expire
- Confirm that the reminder has been set and check the notification settings

## Task 3: Update shopping list
- Navigate to the List and shopping list pages
- Update the purchase dates of items on the List
- Remove any expired items from the List
- Confirm that the updates have been saved and check the lists for accuracy


# Feedback:
- Users struggled with adding a new item in Task 1, unsure whether to tap the "add" button or the "plus" icon.
- Users had trouble finding where to set a reminder in Task 2.
- Users had trouble confirming updates were saved in Task3, realized app automatically saves changes made on List and shopping list pages.
- User is not sure where to save the item and confirm that it has been added to the list.
- User is unsure where the enter/submit button is after inputting the item information.
- User isn’t sure where to check on upcoming expiration dates for her groceries.
To address these concerns, we went back to our prototype taking into account the users’ feedback and this is how our prototype looks now:

# Conclusion:

There is still and continues to be a hefty amount of food that is often left spoiled or goes
past the expiration date in fridges due to the lack of awareness of what one has in their fridge.
Currently, there hasn’t been much attention, care, or possible solutions enacted to solving this
problem. Many people don’t consider this as an issue and simply throw away foods that have
expired without thinking twice of how some people don’t have access to food at all. Our
approach is also able to allow people to practice selflessness and hold themselves accountable
for wiser spending habits. By knowing what foods your fridge contains, the users are able to
make better decisions when purchasing other foods as well putting more effort into cleaning
out what they have in their fridges. The users will perform the primary care as they are the ones
to log what foods they put in their fridges. People who might not have access to food would
also benefit from this approach as there would be a higher probability of more food available
from less food waste.
