# HCI Final Project

Did you know that millions of tons of food go to waste each year, resulting in significant economic losses? According to recent studies, the average American household wastes approximately 200 pounds of food annually, amounting to a staggering $1,500 worth of edible items thrown away. This alarming trend not only impacts our wallets but also places an immense strain on the environment and resources used in food production. With FoodTracker, we aim to tackle this issue head-on by empowering individuals to make more informed choices about their food consumption, reducing waste, and saving money in the process. By harnessing the power of technology, FoodTracker is revolutionizing the way we manage our food, making a positive impact on both our wallets and the planet. Together, let's take a stand against food waste and embrace a more sustainable future with FoodTracker.

Introducing FoodTracker, the innovative app designed to revolutionize how you manage and minimize food waste. With FoodTracker, you can effortlessly keep track of your food inventory, ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Simply add items to your digital pantry list and let FoodTracker do the rest. It intelligently monitors expiration dates and provides timely reminders that you can customize to fit your needs, so you never forget about that ripe avocado or leftover meal again. FoodTracker empowers you to make informed decisions about your food consumption, helping you save money, reduce waste, and contribute to a more sustainable future. Experience the power of FoodTracker and take control of your food management like never before.

# Initial User Research

To better understand our users' needs, we conducted a survey with carefully crafted questions. This valuable data influenced our design choices for FoodTracker, ensuring it meets user preferences. Our user-centric approach guarantees a seamless and tailored experience to tackle food waste effectively.

1. How much food is wasted annually by an average American household? Would you care to take a guess?
   - Do you think you are above or below average?
2. What do you think is the biggest contributor to food waste in your home?
   - Are there particular items you seem to throw away the most?
3. Have you tried any approach in reducing your food waste at home?
4. Do you have a way of keeping track of food waste/grocery expiration dates currently?
5. Would you like to be reminded of when things in their refrigerator will expire?
   - How would you like to be notified?
   - How often would you like to be reminded?
6. Are there any other questions you wish I would have asked?

# Prototype Iterations

Initial prototype: To simplify the prototyping process, we opted to utilize Figma, a widely-used tool. We put in ideas how we thought the app might work:

# Heuristic evaluation:

Through a rigorous process of heuristic evaluation, we meticulously analyzed our prototype to identify areas for improvement. Taking the feedback into account, we iterated on the design, addressing usability issues and enhancing user experience. By incorporating the insights gained from the evaluation, we refined the prototype, resulting in a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Edited text size and color to make it easier to view
Removed one of the add buttons to make moving through the app easier to understand
Added a continue as guest button instead of requiring users to create an account

# Usability study:

To test the usability of our prototype, we asked some family members to complete the tasks below:

## Task 1: Add an item to the List
- Open the app and navigate to the List page
- Add a new item to the list, with a name and date of purchase
- Save the item and confirm that it has been added to the list

## Task 2: Set a reminder for an expiring item
- Navigate to the List page and find an item that will expire soon
- Set a reminder for the item to be notified when it's about to expire
- Confirm that the reminder has been set and check the notification settings

## Task 3: Update shopping list
- Navigate to the List and shopping list pages
- Update the purchase dates of items on the List
- Remove any expired items from the List
- Confirm that the updates have been saved and check the lists for accuracy


# Feedback:
users struggled with adding a new item in Task 1, unsure whether to tap the "add" button or the "plus" icon
users had trouble finding where to set a reminder in Task 2.
Users had trouble confirming updates were saved in Task3, realized app automatically saves changes made on List and shopping list pages
User is not sure where to save the item and confirm that it has been added to the list
User is unsure where the enter/submit button is after inputting the item information
User isn’t sure where to check on upcoming expiration dates for her groceries
To address these concerns, we went back to our prototype taking into account the users’ feedback and this is how our prototype looks now:

# Conclusion:

There is still and continues to be a hefty amount of food that is often left spoiled or goes
past the expiration date in fridges due to the lack of awareness of what one has in their fridge.
Currently, there hasn’t been much attention, care, or possible solutions enacted to solving this
problem. Many people don’t consider this as an issue and simply throw away foods that have
expired without thinking twice of how some people don’t have access to food at all. Our
approach is also able to allow people to practice selflessness and hold themselves accountable
for wiser spending habits. By knowing what foods your fridge contains, the users are able to
make better decisions when purchasing other foods as well putting more effort into cleaning
out what they have in their fridges. The users will perform the primary care as they are the ones
to log what foods they put in their fridges. People who might not have access to food would
also benefit from this approach as there would be a higher probability of more food available
from less food waste.

# One Minute Pitch

The average American wastes 200 pounds of food annually. Surely you have gotten something from the store just to throw all or most of it away a week later? Have you wanted to cook something, but forgot what is in your fridge, or what was still good to use? The 4-food-tracker app allows you to easily keep a tally of your perishable foods. Giving you a list of what will expire, when it is expected to happen, and notifying you before then. 
You can offload your mental list of all the things stashed in your fridge to the 4-food-tracker. You won’t have to double check expiration dates, and will be able to easily see what things are ready to be put into a meal without having to survey the whole fridge.
